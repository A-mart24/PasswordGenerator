# PasswordGenerator
MY TASK:

For this weeks homework assignment I was tasked with completing a password generator that would ask a user how many characters they would like to have along with whether or not they want uppercase,lowercase,special characters or numbers.

USER STORY:

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
